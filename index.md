This is a remarkable era. We have easier access to the Internet than ever before. With a single cable, we have the potential for unlimited information transmission.

Of course, this isn’t the only way information be transmitted now and in the future, but it’s exciting enough.

We are at a critical point in a decades-long cycle, or subjectively hope so. We cannot control economic and political cycles, all we can do is to always embrace change, actively explore new things that may change people’s lifestyle, and commit to building them, making our short journey in this universe a bit more interesting.
