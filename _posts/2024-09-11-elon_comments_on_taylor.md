看了绝大多数[简中网友解读](https://weibo.com/1893801487/OwtSU6V57)的马斯克 X 发言都不全面或者说是错的。
>Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life 

首先这是回应泰勒在 Instagram 宣称自己将会在 2024 年总统大选给哈里斯投票，并署名 Childless Cat Lady 的发文。
>Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven't already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.

>Recently I was made aware that Al of 'me' falsely endorsing Donald Trump's presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around Al, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.

>I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.

>I've done my research, and l've made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it's much easier to vote early. I'll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

>With love and hope,

这个署名是在回应先前特朗普副手 Vance 攻击哈里斯时表示美国就是被这些没孩子的养猫女人搞乱的。
>We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats Bea, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.

马斯克今年旗帜鲜明地站台特朗普，他认为自己的第一个孩子也是因为受到觉醒文化影响，成年后选择变性并和马斯克断绝了关系。

马斯克回应泰勒说好吧，你不是没孩子吗（自认为幽默地混淆 *不想要孩子且没有* 和 *想要孩子但没有*），我给你个孩子（一起生一个），而且我还会用生命照顾好你的猫。中年男人的油腻感扑面而来。

抛开这些事件的戏剧性不说，从两个党派，到社会名人，再到这些人背后的一众簇拥，可以说美国内部对立情绪越来越浓。非法移民继续涌入，社会治安持续恶化，贫富差距不断加大。如果经济按衰退预期走，到一定的程度美国可能会需要一场战争来唤起美国的团结。

而中国目前正陷于房地产泡沫破灭，老龄少子化，地方财政捉襟见肘。届时可能也需要一个事件转移全社会的矛盾。

作为普通人，只有好好锻炼身体，照顾好家人，学习一切有趣的东西，然后祈祷科技变革的发生早于社会变革。
